I had a problem with the grounded checking function as the player was able to jump multiple times in the air when the grounded variable was meant to tell the program when the player was on the ground and allow them to jump again.

Turns out that i needed to add and adjust my grounded calculation as the program who think the player was still grounded at almost all times.
